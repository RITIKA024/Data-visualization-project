Data Visualization project:
In this task, I performed data visualization on a sales dataset using Microsoft Excel to identify key business insights. Pivot tables and charts were created to analyze region-wise sales and profit, product-wise performance, monthly sales trends, and the relationship between quantity sold and profit.
A dashboard was designed to visually summarize the findings in a clear and professional manner. This task helped in understanding sales patterns and supporting data-driven decision-making.
